# SwiftSwizzlingDemo
Playground demonstrating swizzling of native Swift methods

The implementation was inspired by https://github.com/johnno1962/SwiftTrace

It's for demo purposes only is NOT meant to be used in any production code.
The techniques here heavily depend on Swift ABI structures and specific compiler implementation, whether optimizations are applied or not, etc.
